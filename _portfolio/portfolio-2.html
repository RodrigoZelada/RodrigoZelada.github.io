title: "3-D convective heat transfer test"
collection: portfolio
---

We will consider the next test case to valide our shape optimization codes (in following projects): 3-D convective heat transfer test case from 
Feppon, F., Allaire, G., Dapogny D. and Jolivet, P. Topology optimization of thermal fluid-structure systems using body-fitted meshes and parallel computing (2020). Journal of Computational Physics, 109574. HAL preprint hal-02518207. 

Implementations were done by using FreeFem++, mmg3d, advect, mshdist and null-space algorithm.
Details on the article cited above.
Computations were perfomed in parallel on my own machine, 8 cores, AMD Ryzen 9 4900hs.
